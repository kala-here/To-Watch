# TO-~~DO~~WATCH

</br>

### A kata to practice using APIs

Create a video streaming playlist across Netflix, Prime, and Disney+.
</br>
</br>
Have you ever wanted to create a playlist of movies and shows you could stream back to back across multiple streaming platforms?
</br>

Do you hang out with kids and wish that you could create a playlist of only G-rated content for these kids to flip through?
</br>

Well then this kata, focused on practicing API integrations, should have a fun end-result for you. You’ll be showing this off to friends and family in no time.
</br>

Picture a TO DO app kata but where each to do item is a movie or show TO WATCH from a different streaming service.
</br>
</br>

_Let’s build that._
