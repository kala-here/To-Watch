</br>

Create a video streaming playlist across Netflix, Prime, Disney+ and more.
</br>
</br>
Have you ever wanted to create a playlist of movies and shows you could stream back to back across multiple streaming platforms?
</br>

Do you hang out with kids and wish that you could create a playlist of only G-rated content for them to flip through?
</br>

Well then this quest, focused on practicing API integrations, should have a fun ending for you. Prepare to show off to friends and family!
</br>

Picture a TODO app where each list-item is a show TO WATCH from a different streaming service.
</br>
</br>

_Letâ€™s build that._

## Quest challenges

Use [the Watchmode API](https://api.watchmode.com/docs/) to allow users to:

1. browse shows
2. add shows to their to-watch list
3. apply filters:
   1. genre
   2. rating (R, PG, G, etc.)
   3. streaming service
   4. price (free vs $$)
4. on-click -> take me to the show?
